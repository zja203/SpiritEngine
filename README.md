# Spirit Engine
Spirit is free software game engine for Windows and Linux (More platforms may come in the future).
The engine is still very much under development, so features are pretty light for now, but the plan is to create a modular, fast, and powerful engine for games and other interactive experiences on a variety of platforms.
