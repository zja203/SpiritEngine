# What you can contribute
At the moment, since the engine is so early, right now we're only really in need of code.
In the future however, since we want the engine to be as widely accessible as possible, we plan to add translation support, so we'll need translators.

Also, being in such early development, ideas are quite useful too.
Even if you don't have the skills to implement something yourself, feel free to make an issue to request features.
(Just make sure an issue for it doesn't already exist)
